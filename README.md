# ☕ JavaPrograms

A collection of Java programs I wrote during my school years (Class 10–12) while learning programming fundamentals and starting my coding journey.  
These programs range from beginner to intermediate level — covering arrays, recursion, OOP, and core data structures like stacks, queues, linked lists, and binary trees.

## 📂 Repository Structure

| 📁 Folder | 📝 Description |
|------------|----------------|
| 🧮 **Array** | Basic 1D array programs — traversal, insertion, deletion, element manipulation, searching and sorting algorithms |
| 🧾 **Array2D** | Two-dimensional array programs — matrix operations, transposition, and pattern printing. |
| 🔤 **StringHandling** | String manipulation — palindrome check, word sorting, short forms, frequency count, and formatted input validation. |
| 🧬 **Inheritance** | Object-oriented examples — single, hierarchical, and multilevel inheritance with method overriding. |
| 🔁 **Recursion** | Recursive programs — factorial, Fibonacci, GCD, LCM, and number property checks like Magic or Armstrong numbers. |
| 📦 **Stack** | Stack implementations using arrays and Java’s built-in `Stack` class — includes `push`, `pop`, and `peek` operations. |
| 🔄 **Queue** | Linear and circular queue implementations using arrays and `ArrayList`, showcasing FIFO behavior and overflow checks. |
| 🔗 **LinkedList** | Singly and doubly linked list implementations — insertion, deletion, traversal, and searching nodes. |
| 🌳 **BinaryTree** | Binary Search Tree (BST) programs — insertion, searching, and recursive traversals (inorder, preorder, postorder). |

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository is designed for **beginners** who want to:
- Understand Java syntax and fundamentals.
- Learn algorithmic thinking and recursion.
- Explore object-oriented programming concepts.
- Implement basic data structures with clarity.
